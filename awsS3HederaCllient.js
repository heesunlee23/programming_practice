/*
To download a file from AWS S3 to a DApp on Hedera, you need to perform the following steps:

Set up an AWS S3 client in your DApp. You can use the AWS SDK for JavaScript to interact with AWS services. Install the AWS SDK by running npm install aws-sdk in your DApp project directory.

Configure the AWS SDK with your AWS credentials and the desired AWS region. You can do this by setting the access key, secret key, and region in your code or by using environment variables.

Use the AWS S3 client to download the file from the specified S3 bucket. Specify the bucket name and the key (path) of the file you want to download.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to download a file from AWS S3 using the AWS SDK for JavaScript:

Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the code with your actual AWS credentials, region, bucket name, and file key.

In this code, the AWS S3 client is created with the provided AWS credentials and region. The S3 bucket name and file key are specified to identify the file you want to download. A write stream is created to save the downloaded file, and the getObject method is called on the S3 client to initiate the download. The downloaded data is piped to the write stream, which saves it to the specified file. Finally, you can handle the completion or error events to perform any desired actions.

Ensure that your DApp has the necessary permissions to access the specified S3 bucket and read the desired file from it.

const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const fs = require('fs');

// Set up AWS S3 client
const s3 = new AWS.S3({
  accessKeyId: 'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY',
  secretAccessKey: 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY',
  region: 'YOUR_AWS_REGION'
});

// Specify the S3 bucket and file key (path)
const bucketName = 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME';
const fileKey = 'path/to/file.txt';

// Create a write stream to save the downloaded file
const outputStream = fs.createWriteStream('downloaded_file.txt');

// Set up parameters for S3 getObject method
const getObjectParams = {
  Bucket: bucketName,
  Key: fileKey
};

// Download the file from S3
const downloadStream = s3.getObject(getObjectParams).createReadStream();
downloadStream.pipe(outputStream);

// Handle completion of the download
downloadStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('File downloaded successfully.');
});

// Handle errors during the download
downloadStream.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error('Error downloading the file:', error);
});
